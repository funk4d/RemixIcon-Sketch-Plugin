Technical Details:
- Uses RemixIcon v4.9.1 from jsDelivr CDN (automatically loads latest icons)
- Data source: Dynamically fetches your tags.json directly from GitHub on each launch, ensuring always up-to-date icon library
- Supports both line and fill variants automatically
- Fully dynamic - no hardcoded icon list, auto-updates when you release new icons
- Built-in color picker with 14 preset colors for instant customization

The plugin respects RemixIcon CDN structure and attribution - all icons are fetched directly from cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/remixicon.
